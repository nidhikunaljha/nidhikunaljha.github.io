Alzheimer's Diseases (AD) is a progressive neuro dengerative disorder which affects the older individuals and is the most common cause of dementia. Dementia refers to impairment of intellect, memory and personality cognitive functions. 
AD is mostly associated with brain shrinkage and localized loss of neurons, mainly in the hippocampus and basal forebrain.
The loss of cholinergic neurons in the hippocampus and frontal cortex is a feature of this disease, which mainly leads to cognitive deficit and short term memory loss.

The two main microscopic feature associated of the AD are:

* Extracellular amyloid plaques, consisting of amorphous extracellular deposits of beta-amyloid proteins known as *Aβ*  . Excessive *Aβ* formation results in neurotoxicity.
* Intracellular neurofibrillary tangles comprising filaments of phosphorylated form of a microtubule-associated protein *τ*

Other neurotransmitter like glutamate and neuro peptide are also affected in AD.


Therapeutics Approaches towards Alzheimer are :

1.	Cholinergic Activators or Acetylcholinesterase’s inhibitors Eg: Tacrine, Rivastigmine, Donepezil, Galantamine.
2.	NMDA Receptor Antagonist Eg: Memantine
3.	Miscellanous Cerebroactive Drugs Eg: Levetiracetam, Caprylidene, Ginkgo Biloba, Piracetam, Dihydro-ergotoxine.


**Detailed Explanation**


1. Cholinergic Activators or Acetylcholinesterase’s inhibitors

	Since brain ACh levels are markedly reduced and cholinergic transmission is majorly affected, various approaches to augment brain Ach have been tired. Cholinergic agonists and conventional anti cholinesterases like physostigmine produce symptom improvement but it has major peripheral side effects.

	_Tacrine_:

	* Centrally acting anti-achE used in treatment AD.
	* Produces significant improvement in memory, attention and language.
	* Hepatotoxicity is a major side effect. 
	* Other side effects are: Nausea, Abdominal Cramps
	* 6 hours daily/ 2-3 times  daily orally.

	_Rivastigmine_:
	
	* Highly lipid soluble so enters the brain easily
	* CNS selective
	* Mild cholinergic side effects and NO liver damage
	* 8 hours twice daily via oral route

	_Donepezil_:
	* Produces measurable improvement in cognitive activities
	* CNS selective
	* Elevation of ACh level in the cortex
	* Cholinergic side effects are mild
	* Because of long t-half it is administered once daily
	* Well tolerated and NO hepatotoxic.

	_Galantamine_:
	* Selectively inhibits  cerebral AchE and has some direct agonist action on nicotinic receptors 
	* Cognitive and behavioral benefits in AD
	* Dosing twice daily

2.	NMDA Receptor antagonist

	_Memantine_:
	
	* Modest cognitive improvement in moderate or severe AD
	* It blocks excitotoxicity of the transmitter glutamate in a non-competitive and use dependent manner.
	* Better tolerated than anti-Achs
	* Side effects include tiredness, headache and drowsiness.

3.	Miscellanous drugs

	a. Piracetam/ Levetiracetam
	It acts by improving
	
	* Enhancement of learning and memory
	* Facilitation of synaptic transmission
	* Increased tonic cortical control on subcortical areas
	Side effects: dizziness, insomnia and skin rash
	
	b. Pyritinol (Pyrithioxine)
	
	* Activate cerebral metabolism by selectively increasing glucose transport across blood brain barrier 
	* Improving regional blood flow in ischemic areas

	c.	Pirebedil
	
	* Dopaminergic agonist
	* Improve memory, concentration, vigilance, giddiness and tinnitus.
