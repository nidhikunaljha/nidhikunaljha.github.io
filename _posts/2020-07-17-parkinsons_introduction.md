[Parkinson's disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_disease) is common neurodenegenerative disorder discovered and characterized by “[Dr. James Parkinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Parkinson)”. It causes significant disability and reduced quality of life and the prominent cardinal features of Parkinson's are Rigidity (uneven posture), Tremor (trembling movement), Bradykinesia (slowing of body movement), Dementia (mental confusion) and Excessive salivation. It is outlined as progressive disorder that affects movement and results in the loss of dopamine producing brain cells, causing tremors in the hands, arms, legs, jaw and face and/or rigidity or stiffness of the limbs and trunk.

Parkinson’s disease is caused by degeneration of the nigrostriatal system, which is the dopamine-secreting neurons of the substantia nigra neurones that send axons to the basal ganglia. The basal ganglia controls the automatic, habitual responses performed by the human body.

In normal person,the levels of  [Acetylcholine (ACh)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcholine) is equal to their Dopamine levels; in Parkinson's patients, the level of ACh is normal but level of Dopamine decreases, that’s why acetylcholine shows over activity. ACh overactivity is also responsible for symptoms of Parkinson's.

It is difficult to diagnose Parkinson’s disease, as there is no specific test for it. Doctors usually perform other tests in order to rule out other conditions. Often seen in the dopaminergic neurons in the brains of patients who have Parkinson’s disease, are [Lewy bodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewy_body), which are abnormal circular structures found within the cytoplasm. Lewy bodies have a dense protein core, surrounded by a halo of radiating fibers.

The main motor symptoms are collectively called "parkinsonism", or a "parkinsonian syndrome". Parkinson's disease (PD) is a long term disorder of the central nervous system that mainly affects the motor system. Other symptoms include sensory, sleep, and emotional problems. Dementia becomes common in the advanced stages of the disease. Early in the disease, the most obvious are shaking, rigidity, slowness of movement, and difficulty with walking. Thinking and behavioural problems may also occur. The symptoms generally come on slowly over time. 

**Cause of Parkinson’s disease :**

* The cause of Parkinson's disease is believed to involve both genetic and environmental factors.
* There is also an increased risk in people exposed to certain pesticides, have had prior head injuries. 
* The motor symptoms of the disease result from the death of cells in the substantia nigra, a region of the midbrain. This results in not enough dopamine in these areas. The reason for this cell death is poorly understood but involves the build-up of proteins into Lewy bodies in the neurons.
* Mutations on chromosome 4 can cause Parkinson’s disease. This gene produces a protein known as” a-synuclein”. This protein which is normally found in the presynaptic terminals and is thought to be involved in synaptic transmission in dopaminergic neurons. The mutation produces what it known as a toxic gain of function because it produces a protein that results in effects that are toxic to the cell. 
* Parkinsons Disease can also be caused by a mutation on chromosome 6. This gene has been named “parkin”. This mutation causes a loss of function, which makes it a recessive disorder.

Over use/over prescription of antipsychotic drug induce parkinsonism as side effect. Drug induced Parkinsonism is treated with Central Anti cholinergic drugs.

**Synthesis and Metabolism of Dopamine:**

Dopamine is synthesized in a restricted set of cell types, mainly neurons and cells in the medulla of the adrenal glands. 

**L-Phenylalanine → L-Tyrosine → L-DOPA → Dopamine**

Dopamine processing in a synapse. After release dopamine can either be taken up again by the presynaptic terminal, or broken down by enzymes.
